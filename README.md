## Introduction

Fake news, or disinformation, is a growing problem in today's society. It can spread quickly through social media and other online platforms, leading to confusion, mistrust, and even harm. In an effort to combat this issue, the use of machine learning techniques for fake news detection has gained popularity. However, detecting fake news is a complex task that involves understanding the context, content, and intent of the information being shared.

### Objective
Develop a machine learning model that can accurately identify fake news in a given dataset.

## Input

The input to the model will be a collection of news articles, each with a title and body text.

## Output

The output of the model will be a binary classification for each news article, indicating whether it is fake or real.

## Constraints

The model should be able to handle a diverse range of news articles, including those with different writing styles, language, and formats. It should also be able to adapt to changes in the way fake news is presented over time.

## Evaluation

The performance of the model will be evaluated using standard classification metrics, such as precision, recall, and f1-score. The model will also be tested for its ability to generalize to unseen news articles.
